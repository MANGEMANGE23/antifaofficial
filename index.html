            Governments do lots of good things, but they also can do bad things. People can have ideas that are understandable, but simply misinformed, about the world. And if someone making decisions based on a misinformed idea tries to pass a law that way, it can have unintended negative consequences.

            Imagine if the government passed a law saying you can be against racism, but because other people who don't like racism are violent, if you join a group to peacefully protest racism you are a terrorist. It sounds insane, right? That is a real law that people in the U.S. House of Representatives are trying to pass, which a lot of lawyers, civil rights groups and constitutional experts are angry about. In response to violence from people calling themselves Antifa, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/279/text">Senate Resolution 279</a> would call for anyone acting "under the banner of Antifa" a domestic terrorist. Just like Democrats, or Republicans, or Libertarians or Nazis or BLM protestors or environmental advocates, Antifa is an ideology that people who support it gather under.

            You may be aware that some environmental activists commit crimes to try to accomplish their goals. If a similar resolution to this was passed for environmental activists, <i>the Sierra Club would be a terrorist organization.</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/22/who-caused-violence-protests-its-not-antifa/">Even ignoring the fact that according to the DHS, most rioters being called Antifa are actually "outside agitators"</a> (so these aren't even Antifa supporters rioting), this resolution would make it a terrorist act to subscribe to an ideology, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-trump-antifa-free-speech-noah-feldman-20200601-il5dljk3rnddxfxj7yd6vonkg4-story.html">something very, very clearly unconstitutional.</a> This seems a lot like the government doing a bad thing because of someone making decisions based on a misinformed idea.

            We're Antifa Official! We have a very simple creed and manifesto: "to protect and defend the beautiful, delectable taste of root beer from any enemy, foreign or domestic". We officially affiliate with the banner of Antifa, as you can see on the right, and our servers are based in Europe, which means we are an international group. If this resolution was passed, our organization would be illegal. As of now, because of the aforementioned bill, that officially means <b>we are a suspected international terrorist group and are under official investigation by the U.S. Senate.</b> If you join us, congratulations! You will become a <b>suspected international cyberterrorist under active investigation by the U.S. government</b>.
